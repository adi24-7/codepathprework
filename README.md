My App Idea: 
As a non-native speaker of Spanish taking the AP Spanish Language course currently, I have faced difficulties practicing my conjugation. While Duolingo feels great place to start to build vocabulary, it is not effective at teaching conjugation concepts. Online, there are many different websites that explain cojugation rules and provide pratice questions, but the information is not consolidated in one area. For that reason, I would want to create a game-based app that allows user to practice conjugation topics as well as provided in-built tutorials to learn the rules before they can practice. I would also like to add an feature that uses AI to adapt to the user's strenght and weakness to provided personalized questions to improve their ability to conjugate on the spot. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While building the app, I was unfamilar on how to access the assistant tool which would allow me to connect the UI to logic. However, I searched up tutorials and understanding the layout of XCode and was eventually able to access the assitant tool to aid me in the process of making the button functional.
