## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While building the app, I was unfamilar on how to access the assistant tool which would allow me to connect the UI to logic. However, I searched up tutorials and understanding the layout of XCode and was eventually able to access the assitant tool to aid me in the process of making the button functional.
